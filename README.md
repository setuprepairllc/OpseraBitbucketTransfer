# OpseraBitbucketTransfer
Transfers a list of bitbucket repositories from a file and imports them into github

How to use:
Create a file named repos.txt in the same directory as the script.
Add your Bitbucket repository URLs, one per line, for example:

Copy
https://bitbucket.org/your_workspace/repo1.git
https://bitbucket.org/your_workspace/repo2.git
Run the script.
This will read the URLs from the file and process each repository accordingly.
